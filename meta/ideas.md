# Ideas

<!-- When noting new ideas or future directions, consider using RFC 2119 keywords
     (MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.) if you want them to become actionable standards.
     Informal observations can remain as plain text. -->

## Future Directions

### vBRIEF Integration (Tomorrow)

Once strategies stabilize, integrate [vBRIEF](https://github.com/visionik/vBRIEF) for machine-readable task representation:

1. **Soon**: Add optional `tasks.vbrief.json` export from tasks.md
2. **Later**: Make vBRIEF canonical format, generate markdown view

**Benefits:**
- DAG-based dependency tracking (blocks, informs, invalidates, suggests)
- Enforced status lifecycle (pending → running → completed)
- Token efficiency (~40% savings with TRON encoding)
- Multi-agent swarm coordination
- Tooling: validators, DAG visualizers

**Prerequisite**: Strategies validated in real projects, vBRIEF exits beta.
